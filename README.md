# Coffee-Machine-Project-Day-15
This is my project for Python Course "Master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days. Learn data science, automation, build websites, games and apps!" by Angela Yu. 

I might upload my Day 1 to day 15 projects, since I want to share my progress what I've learned.
Also I just started my university again (I left my last university last 2 years because of something).
In my current university I will be taking Data Science course, so python would be fit to my major.
Hope I can graduate with good GPA and keep improving to code python, probably I will learn another languange after or before I'm finished with python.
